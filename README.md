AI Study Assistant
Project Overview
AI Study Assistant is a web-based tool designed to help students generate study notes, solve problems, and summarize lessons using advanced AI prompting techniques. This project demonstrates how different prompting strategies can influence AI outputs to provide accurate, creative, and structured answers.

Purpose:

Make studying easier for students
Provide instant, reliable explanations and summaries
Showcase advanced AI prompting techniques
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js or Flask
AI Integration: OpenAI GPT API
Features
Study Notes Generation – Summarizes lessons in bullet points.
Question & Answer – Solve subject-specific questions.
Dynamic Prompts – Prompts change based on user input (subject/topic).
Step-by-Step Reasoning – AI explains answers with reasoning.
Prompting Techniques Used
System & User Prompt (RTFC Framework)
System Prompt:

"You are an expert study assistant helping students generate notes and solve problems."

User Prompt Example:

"Summarize today’s physics lesson in 5 bullet points using simple language."

RTFC Elements:

Role: Expert study assistant
Task: Summarize lesson
Format: Bullet points
Constraints: Simple language
Zero-Shot Prompting
Prompt Example:

"Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple words."

Explanation: AI generates an answer without prior examples.

One-Shot Prompting
Prompt Example:

Example: "Summarize: ‘Water is essential for plants…’ → ‘Plants need water to survive and grow.’"
Task: "Summarize: ‘The Sun is the primary source of energy…’"
Explanation: AI is guided by a single example.

Multi-Shot Prompting
Prompt Example:

Example 1: "Paragraph: ‘Cats are small animals…’ → Summary: ‘Cats are small, cute animals.’"
Example 2: "Paragraph: ‘Dogs are loyal…’ → Summary: ‘Dogs are loyal companions.’"
Task: "Paragraph: ‘Elephants are huge mammals…’ → Summary: ?"
Explanation: AI uses multiple examples to generate consistent and accurate outputs.

Dynamic Prompting
Prompt Example:

User Input: Subject = Math, Topic = Algebra
AI Prompt: "You are a math tutor. Explain Algebra in 3 simple steps with examples."
Explanation: AI prompt adapts dynamically to user input for personalized output.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Prompt Example:

"Solve this problem step by step: If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how far will it travel in 4 hours?"

Expected AI Response:

Distance in 1 hour = 60 km
Multiply by 4 → 60 × 4 = 240 km
Answer = 240 km
Explanation: AI explains reasoning step by step, not just the final answer.
